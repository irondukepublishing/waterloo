Changes to the public APIs during the alpha release stage:

Version 1.1 Alpha 3:

Class: GJGraph Method: setCurrentMousePosition
This method has been made private. Files from previous versions will load correctly,
but should be re-saved to update them as an unsuccessful attempt to call the 
setCurrentMousePosition method will be made during de-serialization.

Class GJAbstractPlotModelImpl Methods: setName and getName
These public methods have been added:
    getName() returns an ArrayList<String> - containing a name for the plot or
                                             for each plot when multiplexed
    setName(ArrayList<String>) sets the array list
    setName(String) clears the list then adds the specified string as element 0.

Interface GJGraphInterface
    isPolar added to interface.

Version 1.1 Beta
GJFastPlotInterface added and implemented in GJAbstractPlot.

kcl-waterloo-swingx module added. This can replace the swingx-core allowing only required swingx elements 
to be added to th class path. To add swingx-all, rebuild GraphExplorer without kcl-waterloo-swingx
and the swingx submodules.

Version 1.1 Beta2
GJBasicPanel now implements ContainerListener and ComponentListener
GJAbstractDataVector now has a name field, and GJAbstractDataInterface
specifies a getter and setter for it.

The experimental kcl.waterloo.swing classes have been re-written kcl-waterloo-base
      
*******************************                                       
Version 1.1RC2

Data Model
The plotList property has been moved out of the data model and is now in the GJAbstractPlotModelImpl.
Setters and getters have been modified accordingly.
This change allows a data model to be copied by reference between plots even when one is a descendant
of the other without risk of creating infinite loops/stack overflows.

CODE HAS BEEN INCLUDED TO ACCOMMODATE THIS CHANGE WHEN LOADING OLDER XML FILES SAVED
FROM WATERLOO. SUCH FILES SHOULD BE SAVED AGAIN TO UPDATE THEM

GJDataTransformInterface no longer requires GJGraphInterface parameter.

GJLayerInterface no specifies an unused U parameter.

The screen data array has been removed from the plot data model and implemented as a property 
of the plot.

Saving Plots
The GJEncoder and GJDecoder now provide support for saving plots.
The parent graph property will be set to null during the save so no Swing hierarchy will
be saved.
