The canvg.js included here is version 1.2.

There is a known bug that produces improper clipping when plotting polar charts.
This is fixed in canvg 1.3 available from https://code.google.com/p/canvg/

BUT
canvg 1.3 does not load .svg files correctly in FireFox (all mozilla-based browsers?).
See canvg bug report (issue #232).

For the present, I'll embed canvg 1.2 - if you need 1.3, alter the preferences to point to a copy of it.
