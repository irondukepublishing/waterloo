## GraphExplorer
=================

GraphExplorer is a standalone executable jar and can be used to open and view
Waterloo Graphics files.

It also provided a link to Py4J for use in Python

## How To Build
- Open the GraphExplorer NetBeans project in NetBeans
- Right click on the project and select Open Required Projects
- For a first build, ensure the "Build Projects on ClassPath" checkbox is selected
in ALL projects
- Select "Clean and Build"

## Experimental content
GraphExplorer is used in the Waterloo dev process. The /dist/lib folder may 
contain additional jar files that are being experimented with in that process.
Not all of these will be become part of the main distribution or be maintained.

## Replacement
GraphExplorer is likely to be replaced with a set of more complete and user-friendly
GUIs mixing Java Swing and JavaFX in the future.
